known issues:
- once in a while the execution of executeStory() produces a "nullPointer" error. It is not gamebreaking, the player can continue to play the game
- the event database is not filled up, yet. So there are texts missing
- in the dev environemet it occasionally happens, that the db is not reachable anymore. Restart of Eclipse solves the problem

missing features:
- There is no save functionality. It is prepared to be implemented, but not in the actuall release yet.
