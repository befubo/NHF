# NHF

fixed bugs:
- once in a while the execution of executeStory() produces a "nullPointer" error. It is not game breaking, the player can continue to play the game

known issues:
- the event database is not filled up, yet. There are texts missing
- in the dev environment it occasionally happens, that the database is not reachable anymore. Restart of Eclipse solves the problem

missing features:
- there is no save functionality. It is prepared to be implemented, but not in the actual release yet.
